          <h4>Our Goal</h4>
          <p>
          	The Goal we have for this app is to distribute it through the Driller Band Community, to help students with ease when accessing sites and the Band Sites, and that one day this app will be installed on the nice Kindles that were donated to the Band as a resource.
          </p>

          <h4>Our Inspiration</h4>
          <p>
          	We just sat in a class one day, and we were like..."Why not build an App to help band people find stuff with the ease of one simple app?" That is how it started.
          </p>

          <h4>The App's Purpose on Your Device</h4>
          <p>
          	Not only does this app give you access to synergy but it will give you access to the band sites which are a big thing when your a part of the Driller Band.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>App's Quality</h4>
          <p>
          	The app has a great layout and is easy to read, unlike most colored background things(like posters for an elementary school project) and will receive an occasional update when something needs fixing or when the overall looks of the app change.
          </p>

          <h4>Sponsors</h4>
          <p>
          	Sadly no one was a sponsor in making this app. It was planned to be a non-profit app since I designed it for a school to use.
          </p>

          <h4>The Really-Hard to Read/The No One Even Bothers to Read Them Anyway Disclaimers</h4>
          <p id="Disclaimers">
          	This app is not intended to be sold in any shape or form. If you paid for the app, I'm sorry to say but you were ripped off. The app comes as is, there is no in-app purchases or premium versions. We only develop apps to help out our fellow schools, mainly to the music program. Read over the Amazon App Guidlines to check over other rules and check the Amazon App Help page if any questions should arrise, only after if we say we couldn't help you. We are not reliable if your phone gets a virus or bug if you downloaded the app off a site other than the Amazon Store. All copyright belongs to their respective creators/makers (like any app that pops up in an ad which shouldn't affect performance of the app).
